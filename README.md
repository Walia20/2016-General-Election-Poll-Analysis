# 2016-General-Election-Poll-Analysis

##Election Poll Data Analysis
In this project, we'll look at the opinion poll data from the upcoming 2016 General Election. In the process, we'll try to answer the following questions:

Who was being polled and what was their party affiliation?
Did the poll results favour Clinton or Trump?
How did voter sentiment change over time?
Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?

## Can we see an effect in the polls from the debates?
Another interesting thing that we can look into, is what happened on the days leading up to the first debate, and afterwards. We know that the debate was on 26-September-2016, so we'll plot the trends for the month of September.
